# AI-JOB-TRENDS-DASHBOARD---EXCEL
Created an interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard to analyze AI job market trends using real-world data. Integrated pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts to track roles, locations, in-demand skills, and salary insights. Designed to provide quick, data-driven understanding of emerging AI hiring patterns and market opportunities.

This dashboard was developed to analyze the impact of Artificial Intelligence across various job sectors, as AI has become an integral part of the modern white-collar workforce. The dataset used in this project was primarily sourced from Kaggle (“AI Job Trends”), with approximately 20% of the data supplemented and refined using additional publicly available sources.

The analysis indicates that Artificial Intelligence has significantly impacted roles primarily centered around digital services, driving substantial growth in these sectors. In contrast, traditionally blue-collar professions, such as mechanics and architecture, have experienced comparatively minimal influence from AI adoption. Consequently, countries with economies heavily focused on digital services have witnessed exponential job growth, while others have observed more modest increases in workforce expansion.
